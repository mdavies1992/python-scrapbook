# python-scrapbook

Hello, this is a collection of smaller, mini-projects and functions I want to try and make in Python. Nothing is massive individually, but I hope to update this with many exercises and functions I make while learning Python and beyond!
So far in this repository, there are the following projects:

#### 01 - Consonant checker
A Python script that takes an input of a string, and outputs the number of consonants that are in that input. For example, "Hello World" would output "7", and "Turned upside-down" would output "10".
