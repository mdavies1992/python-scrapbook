# python-scrapbook

Hello, this is a collection of smaller, mini-projects and functions I want to try and make in Python. Nothing is massive individually, but I hope to update this with many exercises and functions I make while learning Python and beyond!
So far in this repository, there are the following projects:

### 01 - Consonant checker
A Python script that takes an input of a string, and outputs the number of consonants that are in that input. For example, "Hello World" would output "7", and "Turned upside-down" would output "10".

### 02 - Cave Goblin
As a fantasy and gaming fan, this small exercise is a script that runs a combat simulation between a hero character (the player / you) and an NPC goblin. Choose from a list of moves, and the goblin randomly chooses there's, and deals damage to each other until one of you is defeated! (...or you run away, of course.)

### 03 - Grid Traveller
A script in which the user must navigate a "token" through a grid of 3x3 from one corner to another in a set of movements on the x or y access in a single square, with visuals to be updated as they progress.

### 04 - Lambda Calculator
A one-time, simple script to take two numerical inputs and an operator to set up and complete a computation. I
only just learned about lambda functions, so I wanted to practice using them as they seem pretty neat!
