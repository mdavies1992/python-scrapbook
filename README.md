# python-scrapbook

Hello, this is a collection of smaller, mini-projects and functions I want to try and make in Python. Nothing massive individually, but I hope to update this with lots of excercises and functions I make during my time learning python and beyond!

So far in this repo there is:

#### 01 - Consanant checker
A python script that takes an input of a string, and outputs the number of consanants that are in that input. For example, "Hello World" would output "7", and "Turned upside-down" would output "10".
